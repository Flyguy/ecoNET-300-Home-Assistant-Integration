**Note:** This repository is a fork of the original [pblxptr/ecoNET-300-Home-Assistant-Integration](https://github.com/pblxptr/ecoNET-300-Home-Assistant-Integration). Most of the work was done by [@pblxpt](https://github.com/pblxpt), and we are very grateful for their efforts.
**Additionally, I maintained and supported this code up to version v0.3.3.**

## Overview
he **ecoNET300 Home Assistant Integration** allows local control and monitoring of ecoNET300 devices directly from Home Assistant. It communicates over your local network via the ecoNET300â€™s native REST API, avoiding any external cloud services.

- **Local Operation**: No dependency on econet24.com cloud services.
- **Easy Configuration**: Integrate directly via Home Assistant UI.
- **Tested With**: ecoMAX810P-L TOUCH controller from [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)


## versions
* v0.3.3 - version is stable. Most of the work was done by @pblxpt, for which we're very thankful as the community.
* v1.0.0 - A development version that retrieves more data from the API. It may be unstable, and upgrades from previous versions are not supported.

### Migrating to v1.0.0_beta

> **Important**: This release resets versioning. To upgrade:
> 1. Remove the existing integration.
> 2. Install v1.0.0_beta fresh.
> 3. Reconfigure as instructed below.
